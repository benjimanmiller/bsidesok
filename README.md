# bsidesok
Collection of scripts related to the BsidesOK convention 

## code.py
This script is to be placed in the main directory of the Bsides2024 RPI Pico board.

Currently this script has 3 modes. 

Random Blink - A random LED blinks a random color. 

Morse Code Message - This mode blinks the LEDs to display a message encoded via morse code. 

Red - This mode just turns all the light red. 

### Upcoming
I am going to change Red mode into IR Attack. It will uses the badges built in IR transiever to blast the "power off" code for all possible makes of TVs. The LEDs will blink as the attack blasts IR signls.
